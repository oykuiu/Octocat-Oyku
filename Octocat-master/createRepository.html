            <p class="lead">
                First thing's first; we need to create an empty repository so we can start work on our
                project. In this step we're going to use GitHub Desktop to create an empty repository and a workspace,
                and make sure we can find the workspace on our computer.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>In your GitHub Desktop app click on <em>File</em> -> <em>New Repository...</em></li>
                <li>
                    On the =<em>create</em> tab type a name for your repository (note you name has to have a hyphen
                    instead of spaces (e.g. <strong>cfg-project-1</strong>). Before you press <em>create repository</em>
                    make a note of the <strong>local path</strong> as this shows where to find the code folder on your
                    computer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When you're happy, click on <em>Create Repository</em>. Then find and open the code folder on your
                    computer. You're new repository is ready to go!

                Great! You've created a new workspace on your local machine. But we haven't done anything with it yet.
                In this step we're going to add some files into our workspace and commit them.
            </p>
           <ol>
               <li>
                   Open up this website's root folder in Finder / File Explorer and copy all of the files into
                   the new folder you just created (it should be at <strong>local path</strong> from the last step
               </li>
               <li>
                   Open up your GitHub Desktop application. You should see a list of all of the new files you have copied
                   in. We're going to <strong>commit</strong> (finalize) these changes, now. Make sure the checkbox to
                   the left of each file is ticked.
               </li>
               <li>
                   Fill out a very short description (max 72 characters) of what you've just done in the textbox called
                   <em>Summary</em>. You need to do this every time you commit files.
               </li>
               <li>
                   It's good practice to fill out the <em>Description</em> textbox, too. The description can be as long
                   as you like so you can use it when the summary doesn't give you enough space.
               </li>
               <li>
                   When you're happy with the description and summary click the button labelled <em>commit to
                   master</em>. You've now saved your commit **locally** (only on your computer)
               </li>

            <p class="lead">
                Now you've committed your files, but you haven't sent them up to the cloud yet. The final step is to
                publish (or <strong>push</strong> your changes so they're there for all the world to see!

            <ol>
                <li>
                    In order to make sure everyone can see your changes we need to *publish* (or *push*) our commit. Once
                    you've committed your changes, you should see a button at the top of the GitHub client Window saying
                    <strong>push origin</strong>.]
                </li>
                <li>
                    To make sure your changes have been published, check that the button you have just clicked has changed
                    to say <strong>Fetch origin</strong>. This means there's nothing else to push.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Congratulations! You've just published your first commit! Log in to GitHub using your web browser and
                    make sure you can see your repository online.
